<h2> Description</h2>
With its delicious coffee flavor and gently sweetened mascarpone, classic tiramisu will never go out of style. 
Ado Campeol, a well-known Italian restaurateur, is credited with creating it in the 1970s.

    <ul>
        <li> 6 large egg yolks </li>
        <li> ¾ cup white sugar </li>
        <li> ⅔ cup milk </li>
        <li> 1¼ cups heavy cream </li>

        <li> 2 tablespoons rum </li>
        <li> 2 (3 ounce) packages ladyfinger cookies </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder </li>
    </ul>

<h3> Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li> Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a medium saucepan until well blended. Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil.</li>
        <li> Boil gently for 1 minute, then remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.</li>
        <li> Cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour. </li>
        <li> Beat cream and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li> Remove egg yolk mixture from the refrigerator; add mascarpone cheese and whisk until smooth.</li>

        <li> Arrange 1/2 of the soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 7x11-inch dish. Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, then spread 1/2 of the whipped cream over top. Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle cocoa powder over top.</li>
